    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>3 lbs. Chicken Wings (Flats/Drums)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. Onion Powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. Baking Powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp. Paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp. Salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Dried Thyme</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Cracked Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Directions:</b></h3>


    
    <p>1. In a small bowl, mix together onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, dried oregano, dried thyme, cracked black pepper, and 1 tbsp of the baking powder. Set off to the side.</p>

    <p>2. Grab your 3 lbs of chicken wings and pat SUPER dry. Place in a large mixing bowl and toss with the dry rub you just made. Cover seasoned wings and let sit in the fridge for 4-5 hours.</p>
    
    <p>3. After letting the wings sit, preheat your oven to 250℉. Mix the rest of the baking powder in with the wings. Get a baking sheet and place aluminum foil and a wire rack on top. Place wings skin side up and place in the heated oven for 40 minutes. </p>

    <p>4. After 40 minutes, set your oven to 450℉. Let the wings sit for around 20 minutes before putting them back in the oven. Bake the wings for another 20 minutes and then flip. Place in the oven for another 20 minutes and then take out to rest. For extra crisp, place back into the oven skin side up for another 5 minutes before taking them out to rest.</p>

    <p>5. Once wings are fully done, place in a large mixing bowl and toss with your preferred sauce. Serve with ranch or blue cheese and enjoy.</p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Baked chicken wings are a delicious and healthier alternative to the traditional fried version. These succulent pieces of chicken are coated in flavorful seasonings and then oven-baked until they achieve a crispy and golden-brown exterior while retaining their juicy and tender meat on the inside. Baking allows for a reduction in the amount of oil used compared to frying, making it a popular choice for those looking for a lighter yet equally satisfying option. Baked chicken wings are often served with an array of dipping sauces and are a favorite for gatherings, parties, or as a tasty snack. They offer a delightful balance of flavors and textures, making them a crowd-pleasing dish for chicken wing enthusiasts.</p>
