    <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 Filet Mignons </li>
        <li>Salt & ground black pepper to taste </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>4 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Directions:</b></h3>


    
    <p>1. Remove fillet steaks from fridge 30-60 minutes before preparing. Unwrap, season and let sit on a plate on the counter. For best results, do not skip this step.</p>

    <p>2. Once ready to cook, heat oven to 360°F. Place a medium cast iron skillet over high heat for 3-5 minutes. Once hot, carefully add oil (watch out for splatters). Sear the Filet Mignon for 2-3 minutes per side (1-2 minutes for Petite Filet Mignons), until browned with a nice crust. Immediately remove skillet from heat.</p>
    
    <p>3. Carefully add butter, garlic and rosemary to skillet. Place skillet in oven and bake for 2-8 minutes, depending on preferred doneness (see notes for internal temperatures; remove skillet from oven once internal temperature is 5-10°F below desired temperature).
    As a rule of thumb, 5 minutes will yield fillet steaks cooked to about medium. 3-4 minutes will yield medium-rare fillet steaks. 2 minutes will yield rare fillet steaks. 6-7 minutes will yield medium-well and 8 minutes well-done fillet steaks. The exact timing depends on your exact Filet Mignon weight and thickness. </p>

    <p>4. Remove steak from skillet and place on a plate. Tent with foil, then rest for 5-10 minutes (do not skip rest). Serve with garlic cloves and butter from skillet.</p>

    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>A cooked filet mignon is a culinary delight, renowned for its exceptional tenderness and exquisite flavor. This premium beef cut is typically prepared by grilling or pan-searing to achieve a perfect sear on the outside while maintaining a tender, melt-in-your-mouth interior. The result is a juicy and succulent steak with a subtle, buttery texture that pairs wonderfully with a variety of seasonings and sauces. Filet mignon is often considered a luxurious and elegant choice for steak enthusiasts, making it a popular selection in fine dining establishments.</p>
