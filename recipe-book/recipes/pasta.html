    <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>2 Â½ cups of flour (preferably 00/semolina flour)</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><b>Directions:</b></h3>


    
    <p>1. Pour your flour onto a cleaned surface and use a small bowl or spoon to create a well in the middle, leaving flour on the bottom. Crack the eggs into the well and add the olive oil and salt. Begin to whisk the ingredients around in the flour, gradually pulling the outside flour into the eggs. As the dough begins to thicken up, you can start to use your hands to knead. Knead the dough for around 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth. You can add some extra flour if the dough is too sticky and some water if it's too dry. Form the dough into a ball and wrap with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <p>2. Roll the pasta dough into your desired shape when ready, either by hand or with a pasta maker. You will need some more flour to coat your rolling surface.</p>
    
    <p>3. Cook for about 2 minutes, serve, and enjoy.</p>
