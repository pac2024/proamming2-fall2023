            <p>Agricultural activities — crop and livestock production — contribute to emissions in a variety of ways:<br>
               <br>
            Various management practices on agricultural soils can lead to increased availability of nitrogen in the soil and result in emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O). Specific activities that contribute to N2O emissions from agricultural lands include the application of synthetic and organic fertilizers, the growth of nitrogen-fixing crops, the drainage of organic soils, and irrigation practices. Management of agricultural soils accounts for just over half of the greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture sector.<br></br>
Livestock, especially ruminants such as cattle, produce methane (CH4) as part of their normal digestive processes. This process is called enteric fermentation, and it represents over a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture sector.<br></br>
The way in which manure from livestock is managed also contributes to CH4 and N2O emissions. Different manure treatment and storage methods affect how much of these greenhouse gases are produced. Manure management accounts for about 11% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the Agriculture sector in the United States.<br></br>
Smaller sources of agricultural emissions include CO2 from liming and urea application, CH4 from rice cultivation, and burning crop residues, which produces CH4 and N2O.<br></br>
In 2021, greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector accounted for 10% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture have increased by 7% since 1990. Agricultural soil management activities, such as application of synthetic and organic fertilizers, deposition of livestock manure, and growing nitrogen fixing plants, were the largest contributors to U.S. N2O emissions in 2021, accounting for 75% of total N2O emissions. Emissions from other agricultural sources have generally remained flat or changed by a relatively small amount since 1990.</br>
