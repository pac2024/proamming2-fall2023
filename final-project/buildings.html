            <p>
            <p>The Residential and Commercial sectors include all homes and commercial businesses (excluding agricultural and industrial activities). Greenhouse gas emissions from this sector come from direct emissions including fossil fuel combustion for heating and cooking needs, management of waste and wastewater, and leaks from refrigerants in homes and businesses, as well as indirect emissions that occur offsite but are associated with use of electricity by homes and businesses.<br>
               <br>
            Direct emissions are produced from residential and commercial activities in a variety of ways:

Combustion of natural gas and petroleum products for heating and cooking emits carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Emissions from natural gas consumption represent 80 % of the direct fossil fuel CO2 emissions from the residential and commercial sector in 2021. Coal consumption is a minor component of energy use in both of these sectors.<br></br>
Organic waste sent to landfills emits CH4.<br></br>
Wastewater treatment plants emit CH4 and N2O.<br></br>
Anaerobic digestion at biogas facilities emits CH4.<br></br>
Fluorinated gases (mainly hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs) used in air conditioning and refrigeration systems can be released during servicing or from leaking equipment.</br>
               <br>
               Indirect emissions are produced by burning fossil fuel at a power plant to make electricity, which is then used in residential and commercial activities, such as lighting and for appliances.<br>
               <br>
               In 2021, direct greenhouse gas emissions from homes and businesses accounted for 13% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from homes and businesses vary from year to year, often correlated with annual fluctuations in energy use caused primarily by weather conditions. Total residential and commercial greenhouse gas emissions, including direct and indirect emissions, in 2021 have decreased by 2% since 1990. Greenhouse gas emissions from on-site direct emissions in homes and businesses have increased by 2% since 1990. Additionally, indirect emissions from electricity use by homes and businesses increased from 1990 to 2007 but have decreased since then to approximately 4% below 1990 levels in 2021.
