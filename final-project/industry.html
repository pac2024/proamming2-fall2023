            <p>
            <p>The Industry sector produces the goods and raw materials we use every day. The greenhouse gases emitted during industrial production are split into two categories: direct emissions that are produced at the facility, and indirect emissions that occur off site but are associated with the facility's use of electricity.<br>
               <br>
               Direct emissions are produced by burning fuel for power or heat, through chemical reactions, and from leaks from industrial processes or equipment. Most direct emissions come from the consumption of fossil fuels for energy. A smaller amount of direct emissions, roughly one third, come from leaks from natural gas and petroleum systems, the use of fuels in production (e.g., petroleum products used to make plastics), and chemical reactions during the production of chemicals, metals (e.g., iron and steel), and minerals (e.g., cement).<br>
               <br>
               Indirect emissions are produced by burning fossil fuel at a power plant to make electricity, which is then used by an industrial facility to power industrial buildings and machinery.<br>
               <br>
               In 2021, direct industrial greenhouse gas emissions accounted for 23% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, making it the third largest contributor to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, after the Transportation and Electric Power sectors. From 2020 to 2021, total energy use in the industrial sector increased by just over 1%. Including both direct emissions and indirect emissions associated with electricity use, industry's share of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 was 30%, making it the largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions of any sector. Total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from industry, including electricity, have declined by 14% since 1990.<br>
