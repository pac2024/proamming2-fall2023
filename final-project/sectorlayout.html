            <p>
            <p>The Electricity power sector involves the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions from the sector, but smaller amounts of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are also emitted. These gases are released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to produce electricity. Less than 1% of greenhouse gas emissions from the sector come from sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), an insulating chemical used in electricity transmission and distribution equipment. <br>
               <br>
               Coal combustion is more carbon-intensive than burning natural gas or petroleum for electric power production. Although coal use accounted for 59% of CO2 emissions from the sector, it represented only 23% of the electricity generated in the United States in 2021. Natural gas use accounted for 37% of electricity generation in 2021, and petroleum use accounted for less than 1%. The remaining generation in 2021 came from non-fossil fuel sources, including nuclear (20%) and renewable energy sources (20%), which include hydroelectricity, biomass, wind, and solar.1 Most of these non-fossil sources, such as nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, and solar, are non-emitting.<br>
               <br>
               In 2021, the electric power sector was the second largest source of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 25% of the U.S. total. Electric power sector emissions increased 7% in 2021. Greenhouse gas emissions from electric power production have decreased by about 15% since 1990 due to a shift in generation to lower- and non-emitting sources of electricity generation and an increase in end-use energy efficiency.<br>
               <br>
               Electricity is used by other end-use sectors—in homes, businesses, and factories—and the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation can be allocated to the sectors that use the electricity. Looking at greenhouse gas emissions by end-use sector can help us understand energy demand across sectors and changes in energy use over time.<br>
               <br>
               When emissions from electric power generation are allocated to the industrial end-use sector, industrial activities account for a much larger share of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from commercial and residential buildings also increase substantially when emissions from electricity end-use are included, due to the relatively large share of electricity use (e.g., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; lighting; and appliances) in these sectors. The transportation sector currently has a relatively low percentage of electricity use, but it is growing due to the use of electric and plug-in vehicles.<br>
